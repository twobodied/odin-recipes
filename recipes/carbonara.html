    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a creamy pasta dish traditionally made without cream.<br>
    A combination of perfectly emulsified eggs and pasta water is used to achieve the creamy texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 pound pancetta, guanciale or thick cut bacon diced</li>
        <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, approx. 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil enough water to fully submerge spaghetti. Salt water to taste, (approximately as salty as the ocean).</li>
        <li>Heat a pan to medium-high heat and add olive oil, pancetta and garlic to it. Wait until browned, then set aside.</li>
        <li>When your water is boiling vigorously, add spaghetti to water then turn down the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Combine your eggs, cheese, pancetta and garlic. Whisk them and season to taste.</li>
        <li>When your spaghetti is cooked al dente, save 1/4 cup of pasta water before straining and <strong>immediately</strong> incorporating into the egg mixture. Mix the spaghetti with tongs to fully cover it in the mixture.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the pasta water while you mix to develop the consistency of the sauce. </li>
        <li>Once the sauce has thickened, serve the pasta simply with more grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
